# Assessment and Deployment Kit

## Download

* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install
  * Download the Windows ADK for Windows 10, version 2004
  * Download the Windows PE add-on for the ADK, version 2004

## Install

* Maybe only necessary to install the Deployment Tools part of the ADK?
* Windows PE installer only has 1 option, but is very slow
